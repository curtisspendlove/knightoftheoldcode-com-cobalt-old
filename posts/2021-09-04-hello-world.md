# Hello World!

Every self-respecting developer should start their portfolio site off with a traditional "Hello, World!" post.

:)

Seriously, though. I'm revamping my website and figured I'd take the opportunity to build it out with ``Cobalt`` (since I've been on a huge [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) kick lately).

This site will be *very* barebones for a while as I build out my theme, which I'll eventually call "Squire" (and do something to open source it as a pluggable theme or something for `Cobalt`--don't know enough about `Cobalt` to know what's possible yet.)
