<p>Knight of the Old Code (Developer Portfolio Site)</p>
<p>This is the source repository for <a href="https://knightoftheoldcode.com">Knight of the Old Code</a>, the developer portfolio site of Curtis Spendlove.</p>
<p>This site is currently published by pushing the <code>_site</code> directory to the repo. Digital Ocean Apps Platform looks for the <code>_site</code> directory and republishes when it's pushed to <code>main</code>. (I will eventually make this work better, via a CI/CD pipeline. But I want to demonstrate how to quickly get a site up and running with <code>Cobalt</code>.)</p>
