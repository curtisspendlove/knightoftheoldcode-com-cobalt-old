      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Every self-respecting developer should start their portfolio site off with a traditional &quot;Hello, World!&quot; post.</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>Seriously, though. I'm revamping my website and figured I'd take the opportunity to build it out with <code>Cobalt</code> (since I've been on a huge <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> kick lately).</p>
<p>This site will be <em>very</em> barebones for a while as I build out my theme, which I'll eventually call &quot;Squire&quot; (and do something to open source it as a pluggable theme or something for <code>Cobalt</code>--don't know enough about <code>Cobalt</code> to know what's possible yet.)</p>
