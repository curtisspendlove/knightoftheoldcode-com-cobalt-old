Knight of the Old Code (Developer Portfolio Site)

This is the source repository for [Knight of the Old Code](https://knightoftheoldcode.com), the developer portfolio site of Curtis Spendlove.

This site is currently published by pushing the `_site` directory to the repo. Digital Ocean Apps Platform looks for the `_site` directory and republishes when it's pushed to `main`. (I will eventually make this work better, via a CI/CD pipeline. But I want to demonstrate how to quickly get a site up and running with `Cobalt`.)

### TODO

- add html5boilerplate to credits section
